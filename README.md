Breast cancer detection using Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning approach used to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on medical features such as mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.
A commonly used dataset is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset, which contains 30 numerical features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.
Working Process:
Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values and standardize features.
Train-Test Split – Divide data into training and testing sets.
Model Training – Logistic Regression learns the probability of a tumor being malignant using the sigmoid function.
Prediction – Outputs class labels (0 = benign, 1 = malignant).
Evaluation – Performance is measured using:
Confusion Matrix
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Logistic Regression is preferred because it is simple, interpretable, and performs well for binary classification problems. In many implementations, it achieves around 90–97% accuracy, making it a reliable baseline model for breast cancer prediction.
